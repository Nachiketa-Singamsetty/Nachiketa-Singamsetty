# 👋 Hi, I’m Nachiketa Singamsetty

I’m a Computer Science undergrad with a focus on AI/ML — but what really drives me is building things that are useful, thoughtful, and a little surprising.

Whether it’s a mental health chatbot that listens better than most apps, a smart cane that sees with YOLO, or a cryptography system disguised as a pattern lock — I like working on ideas that *mean something*.

---

### 🛠️ What I’m good at:
- Python, C++, Java — in that order of comfort.
- Deep Learning (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras), NLP, Computer Vision.
- Databases (MySQL), clean data pipelines, and models that actually generalize.
- I don’t just code — I debug, refactor, document, and obsess over the UX of dev tools.

---

### 📂 Projects worth checking out:
- 🕹️ **Game Code Iterator** – A developer-first tool to locally iterate and auto-improve game code using AI. It plugs into your dev flow, reviews code contextually, and quietly suggests what you might've missed.
- 🧠 **Mental Health Chatbot** – NLP-based assistant for early mental health support.
- 🦯 **Ishare Smart Cane** – Real-time object detection using YOLO + Raspberry Pi.
- 🔐 **Pattern Lock Cryptography** – Matrix-based encryption using intuitive visual locks.
- 🌦️ **Drizzle Dog** – Weather app with Firebase & clean Android UI.

> Full list & repos below. Most are real, battle-tested, and documented.

### 🤝 Looking to work with teams who:
- Care about impact *and* implementation.
- Appreciate clean code and constructive pushback.
- Are okay with the occasional bad pun in comments.
