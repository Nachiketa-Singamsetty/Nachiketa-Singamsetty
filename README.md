# 👋 Hi, I’m @Nachiketa-Singamsetty

I like making things that make sense — sometimes to people, sometimes just to me.  
Whether it's a chatbot that listens or a cane that sees, I chase ideas that tug at my brain until they exist in code.

### 👀 Currently exploring:
- Building tools that think *with* you, not *for* you.
- Making AI more than just a buzzword — something *felt*, not just deployed.
- Writing cleaner, quieter code (and occasionally chaotic prototypes).

### 🤝 Open to:
- Projects with soul — even better if they involve deep learning, computer vision, or ideas that sound too weird to work.
- Conversations — about ideas, design choices, things you’ve broken and fixed, or just tech stuff that excites you.

### 🎈 Little things:
- I co-authored a poetry book but I code like I edit — structure, clarity, rhythm.
- I’ve directed short films; storytelling leaks into my UI/UX decisions more than I admit.
- I’m mildly obsessed with making things feel *just right* — sometimes that’s the lighting in a frame, sometimes the margin in a layout.
