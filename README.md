### 🧠 Who Am I?
I'm a Computer Science undergrad who got curious about how machines "think" — and I’ve been building, breaking, and learning ever since.

Most of what I know in AI/ML comes from late-night debugging sessions and figuring stuff out the messy way. I've made things like:
- A mental health chatbot that actually *listens*
- A smart cane that sees with YOLO
- A cryptography system disguised as a pattern lock

> ⚒️ Building things that are useful, thoughtful, and a little surprising.

### 📂 Projects I'm Proud Of

<details>
  <summary>🕹️ Game Code Iterator</summary>

- **Stack**: Flask, LLaMA 3, Ollama, JS  
- **What it does**: A local AI-powered tool for devs to auto-improve Python game code  
- **Cool part**: Runs 100% locally, makes smart suggestions (like adding physics or jump logic!)  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>🧠 Mental Health Chatbot</summary>

- **Stack**: NLP, LSTM, Retrieval + Generative  
- **Purpose**: Conversational support system using context-aware response generation  
- **Result**: 97% response accuracy and way more empathetic than most bots  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>🦯 Ishare Smart Cane</summary>

- **Stack**: YOLOv9, Raspberry Pi, IR Sensors  
- **Goal**: Aid visually impaired users with real-time object detection  
- **Edge**: 15cm precision + voice alerts  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>🔐 Pattern Lock Cryptography</summary>

- **Stack**: C++, Matrix Ops  
- **Idea**: Visual pattern-based encryption  
- **Extra**: Featured as a published chapter in my university library!  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>🌦️ Drizzle Dog</summary>

- **Stack**: Java, Firebase, Weather APIs
